<p style="text-align: justify;">
I earned a B.S. Degree in Robotic Engineering and an M.S. Degree in Electrical (Control) Engineering from [Hamedan University of Technology](https://www.en.hut.ac.ir/) and [Sahand University of Technology](https://sut.ac.ir/en) in Iran, respectively. My academic journey commenced with my thesis, focusing on making a group of mobile robots move together through distributed optimization. This experience introduced me to the basics of optimization and estimation in multi-agent systems.

After that, my main research focus shifted to figuring out how to control things in a distributed way and using learning-based methods. I worked as a research consultant for online platforms like [Tehrantrainer](https://www.tehrantrainer.com/), where I essentially fixed and improved computer codes for published papers, mainly on control topics.

Apart from consulting and teaching, I conducted [my own research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KOzMTRsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). My current research interests include making robots work better together, game theory, handling mistakes, and learning new stuff. I'm particularly interested in how these concepts can be applied in the real world for mobile robots and self-operating systems.

## A data-driven personal website

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages requires you to separate the website's content from its form. The content and metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content and metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository.

Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many features of dynamic content management systems (like WordPress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site.

If you reach a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start overâ€”just be sure to save the markdown files!

Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).
