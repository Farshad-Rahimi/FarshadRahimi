I got a B.S. Degree in Robotic Engineering and an M.S. Degree in Electrical (Control) Engineering from Hamedan University of Technology and [Sahand University of Technology](https://sut.ac.ir/en) in Iran. My academic journey commenced with my thesis, which was all about making a group of mobile robots move together through distributed optimization problem. This experience introduced me to the basics of optimization and estimation in multi-agent systems.

After that, my main research focus switched to figuring out how to control things in a distributed way and using learning-based methods. I worked as a research consultant for online platforms like [Tehrantrainer](https://www.tehrantrainer.com/), where I basically fixed and improved the computer codes for published papers, mainly on control topics. I also was as a self-employed instructor.
Besides the consulting and teaching, I did [my own research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KOzMTRsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) too. My current research interests are distributed control approaches such as making robots work better together, game theory, handling mistakes, and learning new stuff. I'm especially interested in how these things can be used in the real world for mobile robots and self-operating systems.
