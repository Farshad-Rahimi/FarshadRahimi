I am Farshad Rahimi, an accomplished electrical engineer with a Master’s degree in Control Systems from Sahand University of Technology, Tabriz, Iran, and a Bachelor’s degree in Robotic Engineering from Hamedan University of Technology. 
With over five years of experience as a research consultant, assistant researcher, and laboratory assistant, I possess expertise in fault-tolerant control, distributed optimization, and nonlinear systems. Additionally, I have served as a consultant on online platforms, such as Tehran Trainer, where I provided expert guidance on academic and industrial projects, including reverse engineering tasks, such as extracting control structures from existing code. Furthermore, I have re-implemented the coding for various control-related articles published in reputable journals.
My technical proficiency encompasses an  array of tools and programming languages, including MATLAB, Webots (for simulating the formation control of mobile robots), and Julia. Sample codes are available on my personal website (farshad-rahimi.github.io/FarshadRahimi), where I also provide the code accompanying my published papers.
