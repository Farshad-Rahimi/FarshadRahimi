## Multi-Agent System Simulations

### Distributed Formation Control for Networked Mobile Robots

| ![Formation Control](https://farshad-rahimi.github.io/FarshadRahimi/images/opt1.png) | This simulation demonstrates distributed formation control for networked mobile robots using ROS (Robot Operating System). The implementation uses Khepera 3 robots in a multi-agent system where each robot communicates with its neighbors to maintain a desired formation. The control algorithm incorporates communication delays and network topology constraints, making it robust for real-world applications. The simulation shows how robots coordinate their movements to achieve and maintain formation while avoiding obstacles. |

## Fault-Tolerant Control Simulations

### Fault Detection and Estimation in Networked Systems

| ![Fault Estimation](https://farshad-rahimi.github.io/FarshadRahimi/images/fault1.png) | This simulation focuses on fault-tolerant control for nonlinear networked systems using ROS. The system implements distributed fault estimation where each agent monitors both its own state and the states of neighboring agents. The simulation demonstrates how the system can detect and compensate for faults in real-time, ensuring robust operation even when communication channels are unreliable or when delays occur in the network. The fault estimation approach uses advanced observer design techniques to maintain system stability under various fault conditions. |
