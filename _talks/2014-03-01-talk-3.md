**Estimating tolerable communication delays for distributed optimization problems in control of heterogeneous multi-agent systems**

{: .text-justify style="font-size: 12pt" reversed="reversed"}
| <img src="https://farshad-rahimi.github.io/FarshadRahimi/images/opt1.png" width="1200px" alt="TV_network"> | This study addresses the problem of distributed optimization in control of heterogeneous linear multi-agent systems. Instead of assuming a perfect communication medium as in many existing approaches, we consider two important issues arising from communication networks. First, we assume the existence of communication delays when each agent receives information from its neighbors. Second, since communication networks are generally unreliable, we assume that each agent interacts with other agents through random digraphs. Finally, we derive delay-dependent sufficient conditions in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) to prove convergence to optimal solutions. |

### Fault estimation in networked systems

**A distributed fault estimation approach for a class of continuous-time nonlinear networked systems subject to communication delays**

{: .text-justify style="font-size: 12pt" reversed="reversed"}
| <img src="https://farshad-rahimi.github.io/FarshadRahimi/images/fault1.png" width="1200px" alt="GP-PC_bar"> | In this study, the problem of the fault estimation controller design is investigated for a class of nonlinear networked systems over a communication topology. In real systems, due to unreliable communication channels, data may be delayed or lost when it is exchanged between an agent and its neighbors. To explore this concern, in the addressed approach, each agent utilizes an augmented system based on a given communication topology for estimating the fault and the states, both within itself and in its neighbors, where information from neighbors is received with a time delay. Delay-dependent conditions in the form of linear matrix inequities (LMIs) are derived to guarantee the stability and to obtain the parameter matrices of the observer. Eventually, the simulation results are included to illustrate the performance of the addressed fault estimation approach. |

**Distributed Formation Control for Networked Mobile Robots**

{: .text-justify style="font-size: 12pt" reversed="reversed"}
| <img src="https://farshad-rahimi.github.io/FarshadRahimi/images/opt1.png" width="1200px" alt="Formation_Control"> | This simulation demonstrates distributed formation control for networked mobile robots using ROS (Robot Operating System). The implementation uses Khepera 3 robots in a multi-agent system where each robot communicates with its neighbors to maintain a desired formation. The control algorithm incorporates communication delays and network topology constraints, making it robust for real-world applications. The simulation shows how robots coordinate their movements to achieve and maintain formation while avoiding obstacles. |

**Fault Detection and Estimation in Networked Systems**

| <img src="https://farshad-rahimi.github.io/FarshadRahimi/images/fault1.png" width="1200px" alt="Fault_Estimation"> | This simulation focuses on fault-tolerant control for nonlinear networked systems using ROS. The system implements distributed fault estimation where each agent monitors both its own state and the states of neighboring agents. The simulation demonstrates how the system can detect and compensate for faults in real-time, ensuring robust operation even when communication channels are unreliable or when delays occur in the network. The fault estimation approach uses advanced observer design techniques to maintain system stability under various fault conditions. |
